      <td align="center">   <h3> This was the first audio that I created for my class website which I am creating for my final project in this class. I had to first create the audio for this clip by taking the CD and rip the song the "Final Countdown" off. I thought this was appropiate because I teach math. I then had to delete sections of the song until I got the part that I wanted for the beginning and the end before I start speaking. The next thing I did was record myself talking about my class website when I played it back I didn't like how I was just rambling on so I decided to write down exactly what I wanted to say in paragragh form and that seemed to keep me on track and avoid saying "um" as much. From there I started to use some of the tools to make it sound a little better. The first tool that I used was to "normalize" so that it wasn't so loud when someone first pushed on the play button. I then made sure to fade out when I was beginning to speak. I then also "normalized" my voice because it was really hard to hear me at first. I then used the reduce noise tool and that seemed to really help because I don't own the best microphone to talk into so it was producing a lot of static at first. Last but not least I used the fade in and fade out tool for the sound that I put at the end after I was done talking. I think it turned out pretty good!! </h3></td>

      <td align="center">   <h3> The second audio that I created was my "Math Challenge Audio" clip; I created this because I want to use it on my final website for this class which I am creating a class website. One of the tabs on my class website is going to be "Math Challenges" where students and come and see 3 different levels of challenges; low, medium, and high. They will then be able to complete them for incentives. The frist thing I had to do to create this audio was to take the CD and rip the mp3 off on my computer; this took the most time. I used the song the "Eye of the Tiger" to get the students excited about the math challenges. I then went through and imported the mp3 and recorded myself talking. I do not have a microphone or I would've used it because my voice doesn't sound the greatest through the built in microphone with my computer. I did a lot of cutting and deleting on the eye of the tiger song because I only wanted the begininng. I also silinced the music after the first few seconds before I talked. I then faded out the music and in my voice. For my voice I used the normalize tool which made me sound as I am. At the end I faded out the music until the audio was complete. The music at the end is a copy and paste of the music that I created for this project at the beginning. The hardest part for me then was to save it as an mp3 so I was able to put in on my site. I made sure to download the lame folder which made this possible. </h3></td>
